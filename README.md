In the lightColor folder, this is an initial lighting effect for OpenGL using a dual vertex buffer array and dual shaders. The strange thing is that when you replace "Wty. shader" with "Light. shader", the reading fails, and the system reports an error [OpenGL Error] (1282) glUseProgram (m_RendererID) that is puzzling. I hereby upload this program as my own history of hitting a wall.
